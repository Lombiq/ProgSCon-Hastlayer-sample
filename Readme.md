# ProgSCon Hastlayer sample readme



This is a sample project that utilizes [Hastlayer](http://hastlayer.com/) to accelerate computations. The project was used for the demo of the Hastlayer session on the [ProgSCon 2016 conference](http://progscon.co.uk/).

While you won't be able to run this code without Hastlayer you'll be able to get an idea of how the system can be used. Hastlayer will be published in the near future; if you're interested in it today just [get in touch with us](https://lombiq.com/contact-us).

The project's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/progscon-hastlayer-sample](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/progscon-hastlayer-sample) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/ProgSCon-Hastlayer-sample](https://github.com/Lombiq/ProgSCon-Hastlayer-sample) (Git repository)
